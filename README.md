# JetBrains IDE Prefs

This repo provides both a superset of the Mac OS X 10.5+ keybindings for
JetBrains IDEs, as well as a team-centric workflow for tracking and syncing IDE
customizations over time.

## Requires

To run the installer, you will need Ruby 2.0+.

## History

Once upon a time, RubyMine shipped with keybindings that made no sense to anyone
who had ever used a Mac. Hence, the Pivotal Labs RubyMine preferences were born.

Originally just a project for managing RubyMine preferences, it now includes
preferences for multiple JetBrains IDEs. For each IDE, we offer:

* Keymaps (powerful supersets of the JetBrains Mac OS X 10.5+ default
  keybindings)

* Pivotal Code Styles

* Live Templates

Today, this project is not only a repository of Pivotal's preferences for
Jetbrains IDEs â€“ it's also a recommended workflow for tracking your team's
customizations to IDE preferences.

## Installation ##

First, *close your Jetbrains IDE*.

Then, clone this repository to someplace cozy (you'll keep it there) and issue
any of the following as needed from the `cli` directory:

```sh
bin/ide_prefs --ide=rubymine          install
bin/ide_prefs --ide=intellij          install
bin/ide_prefs --ide=intellijcommunity install
bin/ide_prefs --ide=webstorm          install
bin/ide_prefs --ide=androidstudio     install
```

This will install the preferences into your IDE of choice.

## Tracking changes ##

The installation process symlinks the pivotal preferences into your IDE's
preferences folder. Thus, as you and your team change your preferences inside
your IDE, your clone of the preferences will note the changes, and you can
commit and push those changes to your own fork (or even submit pull requests
back to the Pivotal repo for anything you think is generally useful).

## Uninstall ##

If you'd like to uninstall the pivotal preferences and restore your original
settings, first, *close your IDE*.

Then open a terminal and run the following commands:

```sh
# cd into `cli`
bin/ide_prefs --ide=IDE_NAME uninstall
```

## Contributing New Preferences

If you'd like to add preferences for another IDE, simply:

0. Create a new folder in the `pref_sources` directory, and add any preferences
   to it that you want to manage for that IDE into the appropriate folders that
   the IDE calls for. See the existing folders there for examples.

0. Create a new <IdeName>UserPrefDir class inside cli/lib/cli/ide. This class
   must respond to a single method, `#path`, which tells the installer where to
   install the preferences to on the system.

0. Update the README, indicating that another IDE has been added to the
   installer.
